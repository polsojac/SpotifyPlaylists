# SpotifyPlaylists
(Feature 1) 
Grabs 20 most recently added songs and generates 20 playlists based on recommendations from those songs
(Feature 2) 
Visualizes pie chart of your Spotify adds by week, month, or year sorted by genre (choose between the three)
(Feature 3) 
Obtains "current song" being played on Spotify and does a web scrape of the lyrics of that song using the Genius API. If user wants to search for another song, they can do so. Outputs song lyrics to output txt file in current directory with utf-8 encoding.

Keep in mind these are all specific to the device I am using since I have API client_id, client_secret, and redirect_uri saved as ENV variables
